## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end security engineering workflow designed for learning and portfolio demonstration. It integrates:

* Lab infrastructure for safe security testing
* Red-team scenarios simulating real-world adversaries (ATT&CK TTPs)
* Blue-team visibility using SIEM and EDR-style telemetry
* Threat hunting notebooks and DFIR playbooks
* Automated reporting aligned to security frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK, CIS Controls, NIST CSF)

The project is modular and can be executed locally via containers or in the cloud with infrastructure-as-code.

## Prerequisites

* Host OS: Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL2
* Docker and Docker Compose
* Python 3.9+
* (Optional) Terraform and Ansible for cloud or VM provisioning
* Minimum resources for local stack: 4 CPU, 12 GB RAM, 30 GB disk

---

## Setup & Installation

### 1) Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ALFIE-SADMAN/CYBER_SECURITY_END_TO_END_PROJECT.git
cd CYBER_SECURITY_END_TO_END_PROJECT
```

### 2) Create and activate virtual environment (for notebooks/scripts)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3) Start the local security stack

```bash
# Bring up ELK, Zeek, Suricata, and supporting services
docker compose up -d
```

### 4) Verify services

* Elasticsearch: [http://localhost:9200](http://localhost:9200) (health check)
* Kibana: [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)
* Zeek and Suricata containers: `docker ps`

---

## Usage

### 1. Lab Provisioning

* Local: use `docker-compose.yml` to spin up SIEM and sensors
* Cloud/VMs: use `iac/terraform` to provision instances and `iac/ansible` to configure roles

### 2. Offensive Simulation (Red Team)

* Run discovery and exploitation in a controlled manner:

```bash
# Network discovery
nmap -sV -T4 10.10.0.0/24 -oA red_team/scans/subnet

# Web enumeration example
python red_team/tools/dirbuster.py --url http://target.local --wordlist samples/wordlists/common.txt
```

* Execute ATT&CK-mapped scenarios from `red_team/scenarios/`. Each scenario includes objectives, commands, and detection references.

### 3. Defensive Operations (Blue Team)

* Ingest logs via Filebeat/Fluentd to Elasticsearch
* Load SIEM content:

```bash
# Example script to load saved objects into Kibana
scripts/load_kibana_objects.sh blue_team/siem/objects.ndjson
```

* Apply detection rules (Sigma -> Elasticsearch/Kibana queries). See `blue_team/detection/`.

### 4. Threat Hunting & DFIR

* Open notebooks for guided hunts:

```bash
jupyter notebook hunting/
```

* Use provided queries (KQL or Elasticsearch DSL) to hunt for TTPs and IOCs.
* DFIR triage scripts in `dfir/` support quick evidence collection.

### 5. Reporting & Compliance

* Generate executive and technical reports from `reports/` templates
* Map detections and mitigations to MITRE ATT&CK, CIS Controls, and NIST CSF

---

## Data Sources & Datasets

* PCAPs generated by Zeek for network metadata
* Suricata IDS alerts (EVE JSON)
* Host telemetry via Sysmon (Windows) and OSQuery (Linux/Windows)
* Sample benign logs in `samples/` for offline testing

> Ensure you only use benign payloads and lab-generated traffic. Do not target systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

---

## Security Tools & Technologies

* Network: Zeek, Suricata, tcpdump
* Host: Sysmon, OSQuery
* SIEM: Elasticsearch, Logstash/Filebeat, Kibana (ELK) or Splunk (optional)
* Offensive: Nmap, Metasploit, custom Python tools
* Automation: Docker, Docker Compose, Terraform, Ansible
* Analytics: Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Elasticsearch DSL

---

## Configuration

Key configuration locations:

* `docker/` for service-level configs (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, Zeek, Suricata)
* `blue_team/siem/` for dashboards and detection content
* `blue_team/detection/` for Sigma/queries and YARA/Suricata rules
* `red_team/scenarios/` for attack runbooks

Use environment variables and `.env` files for secrets. Do not commit credentials.

---

## Testing & Validation

* Unit tests for parsing and enrichment functions (if provided)
* Replay sample PCAPs and logs, then verify detections and dashboards populate
* Validate rules against ATT&CK techniques (true positive and false positive checks)

---

## CI/CD & DevSecOps

* Optional GitHub Actions workflow to lint, test, build, and publish Docker images
* Policy-as-code checks (e.g., Checkov for Terraform)
* Container image scanning (e.g., Trivy, Grype)

---

## Roadmap

* Add Sigma-to-Kibana query conversion automation
* Expand ATT&CK coverage and scenario depth
* Add SOAR-style automated response playbooks
* Integrate endpoint telemetry from additional EDR-like agents
* Provide Splunk and OpenSearch content variants
